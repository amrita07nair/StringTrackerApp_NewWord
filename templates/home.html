            <b>About StringTracker:</b><br>
            Welcome to the StringTrackerApp! Thank you for making an account with us. If this is your first time
            using the app, here is a bit more about it:<br>
            <br>
            We recognized that being a musician requires more than just playing music; so much more happens
            behind the scenes. Countless hours of practice to perfect performances and taking care of your instruments
            are
            integral parts of being a musician, and we are here to help you with that. Your instrument is important and
            must be reliable with a good sounds, but keeping track of this is difficult. As of now you would need some
            spreadsheet or document to track your playing stats, but this is cumbersome, difficult to organize,
            and easy to lose. Here is where StringTracker helps you. Take the guess work and spreadsheets out of the
            picture, so you can spend time focusing on what really matters, the music! With StringTracker, you can keep
            statistics about your string instruments and the strings you play on and see helpful analytics.
            StringTracker
            will tell you when it is coming time to replace your strings so that you always have a reliable pair of
            string
            for your big performance. No more guess work! StringTracker will also tell you the cost per hour a set
            of strings gave you. Basically, which strings gave you the most bang for your buck! Save your money and time
            with StringTracker!<br>
